        <h3>Rohit Sharma's Test captaincy faces its first huge test</h3>
        <img src="rohit.png" alt="Rohit" />
        <p>
          It's made a spluttering sort of start in Test cricket: Rohit missed
          three of India's five Tests since he became their all-format captain.
          Injuries, in fact, have forced Rohit to miss eight of India's last 10
          Test matches. He was Player of the Match in India's last Test before
          this stretch of games, a landmark victory that took them to a 2-1
          series lead in England, months after they had beaten Australia 2-1 in
          Australia.

        <p style="text-align: center">
          Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is set to miss the first Test
          against India in Nagpur with an Achilles niggle in his left leg, and
          is doubtful for the second Test in Delhi as well.

        <h3>Australia aware of reverse-swing threat amid spin talk</h3>
        <p>
          Australia are prepared for moments where batting could become chaotic
          against India, but will also enter the series with an open mind amid
          all the talk about the role spin could play.
